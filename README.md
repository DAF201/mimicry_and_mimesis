# mimicry_and_mimesis

mimicry:

A tool that can convert any kind of file to an invisible text file.

mimesis:

A tool that can convert the invisible text file back to the original file.#But you need to know the extension or you will just get a ASCII or binary file.

## Warning

Don't use this to convert a huge file, the text file will be much larger than the original file. This is just for evasion of reviewing.
